# GPU-Accelerated-Logic-Re-simulation
Main project goals and milestones 
Project objective:- Develop a GPU-accelerated, timing-aware, 4 value (0; 1; x; z)
logic simulator for replaying RTL traces on gate-level netlists.
Required achievement:- A speed up in re/simulation tasks as compared to
CPU based implementations/softwares.
