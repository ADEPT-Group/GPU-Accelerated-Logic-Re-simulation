<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Main project goals and milestones

Project objective:- Develop a GPU-accelerated, timing-aware, 4 value (0; 1; x; z) logic simulator for replaying RTL traces on gate-level netlists.

Required achievement:- A speed up in re/simulation tasks as compared to CPU based implementations/softwares.


### General Framework
The figure below shows the general structure of the project and deliverables. The boxes in red contain items that are expected to be submitted from us. As we progress along the project, the following questions should be answered at each step. 

1. What are the formats and structures of the files (gv, vcd, sdf, vlib, saif) that are given as inputs or expected as outputs?

2. What preprocessing result is needed as input for the simulation task? What file type and what content or information should be included in order to carry out the simulation.

3. How can the simulation leverage the GPU features and what should be included in the output files?
